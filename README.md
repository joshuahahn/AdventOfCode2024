I took a class called "Parallel Functional Programming" [1] in Fall 2022.
It was a class designed to help students think both functionally and parallely,
which was a big deviation from the straightforward single-thread,
object-oriented approach that I had developed until then. The class was taught
in Haskell as a means to introduce explicit parallel operations, and of course,
Haskell is a functional language >>=

By the end of the course, I felt more confident in parallel thinking. However,
functional thinking was something that I felt was not intuitive. Throughout the
course, I found myself forcing object-oriented patterns into the functional
pigeonhole provided by Haskell. I think that there is great value in thinking
parallely, and I hope that learning Haskell properly this time will help me
think in this new paradigm.

I am going to work through the Advent of Code 2024 [2] in Haskell in hopes that
it improves my Haskell writing, but more importantly, that it encourages me to
think functionally. It is a fun series of problems to work through as well : -)
